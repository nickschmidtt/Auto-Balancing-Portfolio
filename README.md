# Auto-Balancing-Portfolio
Coding Challenge for Stevens Student Managed Investment Fund

In this challenge, I was the tasked to create a class that tracks specific metrics of a portfolio of stocks over a give timeframe. The risk metrics I used to for the portfolio volatility, 95% Value at Risk, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.

The second part of this project creating a system to automatically adjust the porfolio to minimize risk. I create a function to randomly generate weights for each of the stocks and find the new specific ratio, for example the Sharpe Ratio. I found the weights that had this in a range that satisfied the users needs, and made the necessary adjustments to the portfolio.

I also created a function called display_data to visualize the risk metrics and growth of a portfolio versus the market.
